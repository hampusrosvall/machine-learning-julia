## Introduction 

Implementation of common algorithms in Machine Learning using the Julia langugage as part of the Optimization for Learning course at Factulty of Engineering, Lund University. 

## Description 
The folders contain implementaion of: 

* Lasso / tikohonov regularized regression 

* Support vector machines using Fenchel-Young duality instead of Lagrangian 

* Densely connected neural network i.e. foward-/backpropagation 

* Multi-class SVM using average confidence loss and Fenchel-Young duality

## Running the code 

Clone the repository and install Julia and Juno using the instructions on this website `http://docs.junolab.org/latest/man/installation/`. 

Run desired file using for instance the `Atom` text editor along with Juno.
